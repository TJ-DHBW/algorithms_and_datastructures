# Algorithms and datastructures

This projects provides a framework for implementing common algorithms and datastructures.

## Datastructures

- List
    - Linked list
    - Doubly linked list
- Set
- Queue
- Stack
- Tree
    - TODO

## Algorithms

- Sorting
    - TODO
- Searching
    - TODO
- Hashing
    - TODO

## Instructions

Every method that needs to be implemented, throws a `NotYetImplementedException` and is marked with a deprecation notice
in the editor. This means, using "Find Usages" shows every spot that needs attention.

During the implementation of a class you can run the corresponding unit tests, to make sure you don't miss anything.
